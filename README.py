1.1 Create a Maven Project

You can use Maven to build your project. Here’s a basic pom.xml for a Spring Boot application.

1.2 Create Spring Boot Application

Step 1: create a simple Spring Boot application with a basic controller.

src/main/java/com/example/demo/DemoApplication.java

src/main/java/com/example/demo/HelloController.java

1.3 Application Properties (Optional)

You can define application properties to configure the server port, context path, and other settings. For example, you can create a file src/main/resources/application.properties.

Step 2: Package the Application

You can package the application into a JAR file using Maven by running the following command:

bash

# mvn clean package

Step 3: Create Elastic Beanstalk Environment

3.1 Install AWS Elastic Beanstalk CLI

To deploy your application, install the AWS Elastic Beanstalk Command Line Interface (EB CLI).

bash 

#pip install awsebcli --upgrade --user

After installation, configure the EB CLI with your AWS credentials:

bash 

# eb init

This command will prompt you for:

Your region (e.g., us-east-1)
The platform (select Java for this project)
The application name
3.2 Create an Elastic Beanstalk Environment
To create an environment, use:

bash

#  eb create

This will prompt you to select an environment name and other details.

3.3 Deploy the Application
Once the environment is created, you can deploy the packaged JAR file:

bash
# eb deploy

The Elastic Beanstalk CLI will upload your application, create the environment, and deploy it. You can access the deployed application through the URL provided by Elastic Beanstalk.

3.4 View Logs
If you need to troubleshoot, you can retrieve logs using:

bash

# eb logs

Step 4: Monitor and Scale
You can monitor the health of your application and manage scaling using the Elastic Beanstalk dashboard in the AWS Management Console.

Optional: .ebextensions Configuration
Elastic Beanstalk allows additional configuration using .ebextensions files. For example, you can configure environment variables, software packages, and other settings in YAML files.

Here’s an example of setting environment variables using .ebextensions/environment.config:

yaml

 #option_settings:
 #  aws:elasticbeanstalk:application:environment:
 #   SPRING_PROFILES_ACTIVE: prod
 #   CUSTOM_ENV_VAR: myValue


These settings will be applied during the deployment process.

elastic-beanstalk-demo/
├── .ebextensions/          # Optional configuration files for Elastic Beanstalk
│   └── environment.config
├── src/
│   ├── main/
│   │   ├── java/
│   │   │   └── com/example/demo/
│   │   │       ├── DemoApplication.java
│   │   │       └── HelloController.java
│   ├── test/
│   │   └── java/com/example/demo/
├── pom.xml
├── mvnw
└── target/                 # Contains packaged JAR after running mvn package

 This basic boilerplate provides a starting point for deploying a Java (Spring Boot) application to AWS Elastic Beanstalk. Once deployed, Elastic Beanstalk will handle the provisioning of resources like EC2 instances, load balancing, and auto-scaling.
